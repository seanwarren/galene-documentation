Acquiring data
==================================

Configuring your microscope
----------------------------------
Data must be acquired in a 'time tagged, time resolved' (TTTR) mode, also known as 'first in, first out' (FIFO).
At the moment, data acquired using FLIM systems from `Becker and Hickl <http://www.becker-hickl.com>`_ and `Picoquant <http://www.picoquant.com>`_ are supported. 
If you have TTTR data acquired using a different FLIM system please contact us and we may be able to add support for your data. 

The systems should be set up as discussed below. 

Picoquant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Picoquant data should be acquired in a TTTR 'T3' mode. 

Generally integrated microscope 
systems, for example from Lieca, acquire data in this mode automatically.




Data acquired using the PicoHarp 300, TimeHarp 260 and HydraHarp 400 are supported. 

Files written in the older .pt3 and newer .ptu formats are supported

Becker and Hickl 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FIFO imaging mode is available in the SPC-830, SPC-150, SPC-152, and SPC-154 modules.
