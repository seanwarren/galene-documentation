Getting started
===============================

System Requirements
-----------------------
Galene is fairly computationally intensive and will benefit significantly from a modern multicore CPU with plenty of RAM. 
As a guideline, we would suggest at least 8 GB of RAM. Only 64 bit processors and operating systems are supported. 

Galene can optionally take advantage of modern GPUs from NVIDIA to accelerate motion correction. GPUs must support CUDA compute capability 3.0.

Installing on Windows
-----------------------
- Galene is supported on Windows 7 or higher.
- Download the Windows installer from `<http://flimfit.org/galene>`_. 
- Run the installer
- Run Galene from the Start menu

Installing on macOS
-----------------------
- Galene is supported on macOS 10.11 El Capitan or above. 
- Download the Mac disk image from `<http://flimfit.org/galene>`_.
