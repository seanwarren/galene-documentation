==================
Galene
==================
Galene is a tool to correct for sample motion in intravital FLIM. FLIM is often implemented using laser scanning microscopy (LSM). To acquire enough data, a FLIM image is constructed by integrating over many frames. If the sample moves during the acquisition, the image will be rendered unusable.  

If data is recorded in a 'time tagged, time resolved' (TTTR) manner, each photon arrival is stored individually. From this data, the constituent frames of the image can be individually reconstructed. Using an approach based on the Lucasâ€“Kanade framework, Galene estimates the sample displacement during each frame relative to a reference frame.  Using this information, the FLIM image may be reconstructed accounting for this motion, reassigning each photon arrival to the correct pixel producing a distortion-free image. For more information please see `Warren et al. 2017 <http://doi.org/.....>`_

This documentation will help you get started using Galene.
